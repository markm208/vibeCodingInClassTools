This is a repo of different single web page visualizations of topics that I cover in my CS courses. There are nearly 100% written by AI where I told the AI assistant what I wanted and iterated until it got it right. In other words, these are 'vibe coded'.

These can be viewer in a browser using a link like this:

```https://markm208.github.io/vibeCodingInClassTools/NAME-OF-FILE```

For example, this is a link to one of the examples:
